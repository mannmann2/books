About:
__

This collection of 100 of O Henry's finest stories is a showcase for the sheer variety of one of America's best and best-loved short story writers

The variety of the stories is amazing; O Henry is as at home describing life south of the Rio Grande as he is chronicling the activities and concerns of 'the four million' ordinary citizens who inhabited turn-of-the-century New York. 

They are marked by coincidence and surprise endings as well as the compassion and high humour that have made O Henry's stories popular for the last century.
